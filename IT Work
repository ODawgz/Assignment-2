								<h2><strong>Michael Kendra</strong></h2>
								<h3><b>Software Engineer @ Canva </b><br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelkendra/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelkendra/</a></h3>
								<p>Michael Kendra despite only being an IT Professional for 4 years has acquired various 
								lucrative experiences in different employments, starting his career at Polish company 
								Evojam as an intern before acquiring a permanent position. From Evojam Michael would 
								use his experience to become a software engineer at FairFax Media not long before joining 
								Canva through a rigorous process of employment where he was chosen for the position out of 
								100 applicants. Michael describes Scala as his &#39;bread and butter&#39; whilst claiming to be 
								&#34;constantly learning, practicing and improving in writing high-quality and scalable 
								backends for web applications&#34;.</p>

								<h2><strong>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong></h2>
								<p><strong>Q: The role of &#39;Software Engineer&#39; varies across each position, in your current employment
 								what does the role demand from you?</strong>
								<br>
								<b>A:</b> Closely working with people who have a certain vision for the product, providing the 
								technical ability to deliver their vision to reality, and the initiative to go beyond what 
								is asked of you due to the rapid development of Canva there isn&#39;t always someone there to 
								hold your hand.</p>

								<h2><strong>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong></h2>
								<p><strong>Q: There to this day seems to be a &#39;stereotype&#39; where people assume that the average IT professional 
								makes little to no contact with fellow colleagues, in your experience how untrue or true is 
								this?</strong>
								<br>
								<b>A:</b> 100% untrue because simply, no good work is done in isolation. The best companies work 
								in teams. To create something effective you need to work with designers and even the CEO, 
								you can&#39;t deliver on your own.
								<br>
								<strong>Q: Aside from fellow colleagues, do you interact with clients, investors or even the general public?</strong>
								<br>
								<b>A:</b> Not directly with the general public. On Fridays we have what are called &#39;Public 
								Standups&#39; where the CEO talks with the company about things such as user feedback and she 
								might ask us to create mockups to see if we can satisfy their requests so directly no, 
								but instead indirectly. It&#39;s tricky because that interaction with the general public takes 
								skill and we have completely separate teams who work directly with the general public.</p>
			
								<h2><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></h2>
								<p><b>Q: In an average day at work, where do you spend most of your time?</b>
								<br>
								<b>A:</b> Lately not at my desk due to the amount of meetings I&#39;ve had. But in a more general 
								sense I would find myself at my desk.
								<br>
								<b>Q: Naturally as an IT professional lots of your time is no doubt spent at a desk, are there 
								any opportunities for you to &#39;break away&#39; from your desk?</b>
								<br>
								<b>A:</b> Yes, we have a cafe in the building where a lot of the time we would go down to get 
								coffee. We also have designated lunch times. Meetings are another time to get away from the 
								desk things like project management, engineering forums etc. We also have kitchens where 
								we can make something to eat.<p>

								<h2><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></h2>
								<p><b>Q: As a Software Engineer at Canva, which aspect of your position would you say is 
								&#39;most challenging&#39;?</b>
								<br>
								<b>A:</b> The fact that the company is moving so quickly because we have to make sure to maintain 
								high quality in engineering and high quality in company culture to make sure it&#39;s improving.
								<br>
								<b>Q: When you encounter such challenges, what is your process of working through them?</b>
								<br>
								<b>A:</b> There&#39;s a big focus on processes like code review as well as people writing design 
								documents. Also there&#39;s a huge focus on how new hires are brought into the company, 
								long process of onboarding - getting time to learn the company which is in itself a 
								challenge, overcoming these growing pains. But all these processes, the long onboarding, 
								the design documents are all made to ensure when we reach challenges we know how to go 
								about them and so that others can help us more easily.</p>
